Next steps:

(1) add tests and continous integration.

(2) add another molecule type and color code on animation.

(3) add reaction A + B --> C and create additional plot showing fraction of A, B, and C vs time.

(4) compare with stochastic and macroscopic results.

(5) add parallelization and more strategic object-oriented programming.
